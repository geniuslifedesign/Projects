## Introduction
Practicing classification algorithms that I recently learned in a Coursera course.

## About Dataset
This dataset contains past due loans. The Loan_train.csv data set includes details of 346 customers whose loan are already paid off or defaulted.

## Classification
Now, I will use use the training set to build an accurate model. Then use the test set to report the accuracy of the model
You should use the following algorithm:
- K Nearest Neighbor(KNN)
- Decision Tree
- Support Vector Machine
- Logistic Regression
