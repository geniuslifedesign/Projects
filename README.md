## Introduction

For this Capstone project, I am creating a hypothetical scenario in which a Philadelphia tourism company would like to improve tourist products and services sold to travelers. The goal of this project is to optimize sightseeing packages for the City of Phildelphia.

## Business Problem

Providers of hospitality and travel services should dig deep into structured and unstructured big data sources in order to enhance experiences offered to tourists. A place that has better records of their tourist data provides better services. Hidden in big data are useful insights that can be extracted. Clustering this data gives a better understanding of touristâ€™s habits, preferences, behavior patterns and needs. By exploiting geolocation data you have the ability to create more engaging tourists routes by analyzing traffic flow. 

## Data

I will combine a list of Philadelphia neighborhoods that can be scraped from this [Wikipedia Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Philadelphia_neighborhoods) together with a list of zip codes and geographic coordinates downloaded from [OSD](https://public.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/us-zip-code-latitude-and-longitude/table/?refine.state=PA&q=philadelphia) to develop the dataset.

I will leverage data using Foursquare API's geolocation function to gain knowledge on what influences tourists to visit Philadelphia.
