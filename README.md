## Introduction

For this Capstone project, I am creating a hypothetical scenario for a Philadelphia tourism company that would like to improve their tourist product and service they sell to travelers eventually increasing revenue. The goal this project to produce optimize travel and sightseeing packages for a historical city such as Phildelphia.

## Business Problem

Providers of hospitality and travel services should dig deep in to structured and unstructured big data sources in order to enhance the experience they are offering to tourists. There are useful insights hidden in big dta that can be extracted. Clustering this data gives a better understanding of touristâ€™s habits, preferences, behavior patterns, and needs. And, by exploiting geolocation data thay ahve the ability to create more engaging tourists routes by analyzing traffic flow. 

## Data

I will combine a list of Philadelphia neighborshood that can be scraped from this [Wikipedia Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Philadelphia_neighborhoods) and download a list Zip Codes and Geographia Coordinates from [OSD](https://public.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/us-zip-code-latitude-and-longitude/table/?refine.state=PA&q=philadelphia) to develop dataset.

I will leverage data using Foursquare API's geolocation function to gain knowledge on what influences tourists to Philadelphia.

a place which has better records of their tourist data provides better services
