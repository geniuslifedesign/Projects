## Introduction

For this Capstone project, I am creating a hypothetical scenario for a Philadelphia tourism company that would like to improve tourist products and services that they offer to travelers. The goal of this project to optimize sightseeing packages for The City of Phildelphia.

## Business Problem

Providers of hospitality and travel services should dig deep into structured and unstructured big data sources in order to enhance experiences they are offering to tourists. A place which has better records of their tourist data provides better services. Hidden in big data are useful insights that can be extracted. Clustering this data gives a better understanding of touristâ€™s habits, preferences, behavior patterns, and needs. And, by exploiting geolocation data you have the ability to create more engaging tourists routes by analyzing traffic flow. 

## Data

I will combine a list of Philadelphia neighborshood that can be scraped from this [Wikipedia Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Philadelphia_neighborhoods) together with a list Zip Codes and Geographia Coordinates downloaed from [OSD](https://public.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/us-zip-code-latitude-and-longitude/table/?refine.state=PA&q=philadelphia) to develop dataset.

I will leverage data using Foursquare API's geolocation function to gain knowledge on what influences tourists to Philadelphia.
