## About Dataset
This dataset contains past due loans. The Loan_train.csv data set includes details of 346 customers whose loan are already paid off or defaulted.

## Classification Algorithms
First, I will use a training set to build an accurate model. Then, I will use a test set to report the accuracy of each model using the following classification algorithms:
- K Nearest Neighbor(KNN)
- Decision Tree
- Support Vector Machine
- Logistic Regression
