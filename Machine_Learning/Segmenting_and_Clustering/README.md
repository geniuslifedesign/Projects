## Introduction

Converting addresses into their equivalent latitude and longitude values, I used the Foursquare API to explore neighborhoods in Philadelphia. Also, Utilizing the **explore** function to get the most common venue categories in each neighborhood, and then use this feature to group the neighborhoods into clusters. Used the *k*-means clustering algorithm to complete task. Then finally, I used the Folium library to visualize the neighborhoods in Philadelphia and their emerging clusters.

## Business Problem

Providers of hospitality and travel services should dig deep into structured and unstructured big data sources in order to enhance experiences offered to tourists. A place that has better records of their tourist data provides better services. Hidden in big data are useful insights that can be extracted. Clustering this data gives a better understanding of tourist’s habits, preferences, behavior patterns and needs. By exploiting geolocation data you have the ability to create more engaging tourists routes by analyzing traffic flow. 

## Data

I will combine a list of Philadelphia neighborhoods that can be scraped from this [Wikipedia Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Philadelphia_neighborhoods) together with a list of zip codes and geographic coordinates downloaded from [OSD](https://public.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/us-zip-code-latitude-and-longitude/table/?refine.state=PA&q=philadelphia) to develop the dataset.

## Methodology

People in some way tend to appreciate travel experience personalization. Customer segmentation entails dividing all your customers according to their preferences and adaptation of the general stack of services to satisfy the needs of every group. Thus, the key idea is to find one solution that would fit all cases. In its turn, personalization is a trick that allows providing a specific service to a particular person. Thus, personalization makes this process deeper.

## Results

Policy makers, government and municipality departments will be capable of better understanding the tourist’s habits, preferences, behavior patterns, and needs. This way they can improve the tourist product and service they are selling to travelers. Starting from marketing the service and finishing with infrastructure improvements.

Another large group is the business managers like providers of hospitality and travel services. Destination managers, product developers, travel agents, tour managers, hotel and restaurant managers are among the position which can achieve sweet impact to their overall performance. Last but not least are the transportation planners. Their job is crucial for citizens and travelers to be served in the most efficient way.

## Conclsion

Once you have the data, the entrepreneurial spirit should do the rest. Geolocation big data might give you information location, consumer preferences, traffic flow, locations and so on. The mining of unstructured data can give us not just quantitative but also qualitative information on what tourists experience on a particular destination, what they need, what they like or dislike. The rest is a lot of work to be done.
